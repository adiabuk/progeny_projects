1)Description of Anaconda Install Methods (and ways of updating it)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
------------

 - "fully exploded tree" - this is a tree which in the root has the
   the 'RedHat' directory from every CD image merged into a single
   'RedHat' directory.

 - "ISO" - the ISO image for a CD image.

 - "anaconda update" - patches for anaconda to fix bugs/etc

 - all paths without a leading '/' are relative to directory specified
   to installer containing install source.

 - 'updates.img' is a ext2 filesystem containing the updated python
   sources and modules for anaconda.
          
Current Installation Methods:
-----------------------------

- CDROM
-------

  Summary:
      This is pretty self-explanatory.  Mounts the CD and installs packages,
      prompts user to switch CDs when the next disc is required.

  Update Options: 
      - floppy.
      - 'updates.img' file in '/RedHat/base' directory of CD #1 image.

- NFS (from a fully exploded tree)
----------------------------------

  Summary:
      Mounts directory from NFS server.

  Update Options:
      - floppy.
      - 'updates.img' file in 'RedHat/base' directory.
      - updated python sources or modules in 'RHupdates/' directory are 
        used in preference to those in original.

- NFS (from a directory of ISOs)
--------------------------------

  Summary:
      Loopback mounts ISO images from NFS server.

  Update Options:
      - floppy
      - 'updates.img' file in 'RedHat/base' directory 

- FTP/HTTP (from a fully exploded tree)
---------------------------------------

  Summary:
      Pulls files from tree via FTP.

  Update Options:
      - floppy.
      - 'updates.img' file in 'RedHat/base' directory.

- FTP/HTTP (from a directory of loopback-mounted ISOs)
------------------------------------------------------

  Summary:
      Pulls files from tree via FTP.  Looks in 'disc1/' directory to contain
      files from CD #1, 'disc2/' for CD #2, etc.  These can be created on the
      server by loopback mounting the ISO images into these directories under
      the directory made available to ftp.

  Update Options:
      - floppy
      - 'updates.img' file in '/RedHat/base' directory in ISO image for CD #1.

Hard Drive from ISOs
--------------------

  Summary:
      Similar to NFS ISO-based method - loopback mounts ISOs in directory
      specified by user.

  Update Options:
      - floppy.
      - 'updates.img' file in '/RedHat/base' directory of ISO image for CD #1.
  

2)Extra Notes:
--------------

   By default NFS, harddrive, and CDROM-based installs are graphical, unless
the 'text' option is passed on the boot command line.

   FTP and HTTP are text-based, unless 'graphical' is passed on the command
line.  For a graphical FTP or HTTP install to occur, one of the following
must be true:

   - the file 'RedHat/base/stage2.img' must exist on the install server. In
     this case this file is downloaded int RAM, taking about 64MB to store.
     It is recommended to only use this option on machines with more than
     192MB of RAM.

 or:
 
   - the rescue CD is in the CD drive, in which case the stage2.img file
     will be mounted from the rescue CD.  The packages will still be 
     downloaded from the FTP/HTTP server.  No additional memory is required
     because the second stage of the installer is mounted from the CD.

   You can also specify 'graphical' or 'text' as kickstart directives in
the kickstart config file you use, and this has the same affect as if you
put the directive on the boot command line.
